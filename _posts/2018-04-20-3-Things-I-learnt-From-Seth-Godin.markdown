**Provide Value** The best way to market since a long itme is to provide so much value,that people getting talking about it and spreading your idea

**Build a tribe** Build a following of 1000 people in your social media i.e  youtube subscribers or twitter followers
 Once you build 1000 followers ,they will share and spread your ideas nad promote you
 
**Ship it** Never miss out on commitment ,be it delivery of your product or writing a blog post regularly. Talks and dreams dont help
as much if you dont get your hands dirty. Go , start writing that blog post that you have been thinking of, or anything that you have been
procastinating for too long
