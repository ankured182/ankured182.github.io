 You should start before you are fully ready,because you can prepare yourself for the future.
 
Imagine yourself pressing a buzzer even before you thought about the answer.
In that way you dont miss the chance if you actually know the right answer.

You should start writing a blog before you feel confident that you have it in you to write a great blog.
Your will and your heart should get you started.
