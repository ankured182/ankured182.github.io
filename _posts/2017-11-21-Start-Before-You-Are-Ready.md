 You should start before you are fully ready,because you can prepare yourself for the future.
 
Imagine yourself pressing a buzzer with your hand even though you have not thought about the answer.

You should raise your hand even when you do not know the answer.In that way you dont miss the chance if you actually know the right answer.

You should start writing a blog before you feel certain that you have it in you to write a great blog
